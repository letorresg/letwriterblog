## Some Reviews of Seven Worlds:

* [RPG.NET](https://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/17/17549.phtml)
    * _"When it comes to a thoughtful sci-fi setting, Seven Worlds is at the forefront."_ 
    * _"The game faces stiff competition from a number of well-designed products... [but] when it comes to basing itself on science, Seven Worlds buries them all."_
    * _"If it weren't for the good design and the setting's clever ideas, I'd recommend [Seven Worlds] for its audacity alone."_ 
    * _"The Seven Worlds Campaign Book is an unforgettable experience... as a player, you want to say you played this. As a GM, take a deep breath and start preparing."_

* [Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/sealofapproval.php#sevenworlds)
    * _"Mr. Torres ... has done a rocket-roaring good job. Spacecraft propulsion systems have realistic numbers, the space combat system is diamond hard..."_
    * _"Yes, [the 3-D starmap] is accurate, I checked it against one of my own star maps I created using the Hipparcos stellar catalog."_
    * _"This is the sort of top-notch work I was hoping for when I wrote this website. Mr. Torres has done his homework and it shows. I'm going to be purchasing a copy of this one when it comes out."_

* [Halfway Station](https://andyslack.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/review-seven-worlds-campaign/)
    * _"[The Seven Worlds Campaign] would make a pretty good TV series."_
    * _"If you can find 4-5 hard SF fans who love The Expanse and Babylon 5... they will love Seven Worlds!"_
